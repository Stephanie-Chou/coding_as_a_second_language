## Resources from "Coding as a Second Language" SOL at Grace Hopper 2015

Michelle Glauser has one of the most comprehensive compilations of "Learn to Code" resources around:
<http://michelleglauser.blogspot.com/2013/03/resources-for-learning-to-code-and.html>

Here are some other resources we brought up in our Student Opportunity Lab:

### Meetup Groups focused on Women in Technology:
* Girl Develop It <https://www.girldevelopit.com>
* Women Who Code <https://www.womenwhocode.com>
* RailsBridge <www.railsbridge.org>
* RailsGirls  <http://railsgirls.com/>

### Women in Tech Groups
* The Women in Tech slack channel is a great place to ask questions or find other women programmers
<http://witchat.github.io/>
* As is the DevChix email list <http://www.devchix.com/>

### Pair Programming
* Sarah Mei wrote a great blog post about pairing with junior developers. If you're looking to pair with someone more experienced but they haven't paired before, there is a ton of great advice <http://www.devmynd.com/blog/2015-1-pairing-with-junior-developers/>
* If you're interested in finding a pairing partner, check out <https://www.os4w.org/>

### Interviewing Resources
* Interview Cake - <https://www.interviewcake.com/>
* Cracking the Coding Interview - <http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850>
* Julia Grace's "An Unconventional Guide for Getting a Software Engineering Job -  <http://www.juliahgrace.com/blog/2015/4/9/an-unconventional-guide-for-getting-a-software-engineering-job>
* Julia Evans' excellent "Questions I'm Asking in Interviews" -  <http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/>

### Job listing resources (thanks to [@sienatime](https://twitter.com/sienatime>) for these)
* Angel.co - <https://angel.co/> this is specifically for startups that are hiring.
* themuse - <https://www.themuse.com/> this was one of my instructor's top picks
* Hacker News who's hiring thread - this gets the most traffic on the first of every month but is definitely a good resource <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8394339> (that's an example month) This is not limited to the Bay Area but still a good place to find jobs that might not otherwise be listed. 
* HackerX - <http://www.hackerx.org/> this was described to me as "Hackbright career day but for everyone"
* Hackmatch - <http://hackmatch.com/>

####I don't have any experience with these, but people have mentioned them
* Power to Fly - <https://www.powertofly.com/>
* GapJumpers does blind coding auditions - <https://www.gapjumpers.me/>

### Conference Talks
##### These are mostly Ruby because that's my language of choice, but there are tons of conferences that have talks online. I reccomend going to the conference website for a specific year (eg. <http://railsconf.com/program>) or the lanyard site (e.g. http://lanyrd.com/2014/railsconf/) and scanning through for things that sound interesting.
* RailsConf - <http://confreaks.tv/conferences/railsconf>
* Madison Ruby - <http://confreaks.tv/conferences/madison-ruby>
* RubyConf - <http://confreaks.tv/conferences/ruby-conference>
* PyVideo - <http://pyvideo.org/>
